Simple Allen Carroll Replication
================================

This repository contains minimal code that can be used to replicate [Allen and Carroll (2001)](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/IndivLearningAboutC.pdf). 

This branch contains efforts to use numba to speed up calculation. 

See exploration_exploitation_consumption for the version that implements lifecycle.
